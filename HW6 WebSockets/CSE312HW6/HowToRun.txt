Some specs of my machine:
Python 3.8.1
Window 10
PyCharm 2019.3.3 x64
Google Chrome

1.)
To run my program

In the same directory as my tcpserver.py

In a command line, do:
python tcpserver.py
(I'm using python 3.8.1)

In a browser (I used Chrome), go to localhost:8000
Please make sure port 8000 is not taken

2.) go to network section of inspect element and refresh
click on socket and the response from server should be 101 Switching Protocols
This is my objective 1

3.) In my homepage, type in random text in username and message and click submit.
The python console should display the json as bytes and as dictionary
There is a rando button that would put 500 characters to username and password.
Clicking submit also return text to the table row.
This is my objective 2 and 3

4.) open up multiple tabs of localhost:8000
submitting a message with one of them should result in displaying from the other.
This is my objective 4

Program stucture.
By using ThreadingTcpServer of python library, each request open up a socket connection
and the code keep the one with socket request alive. By putting the socket recv in a while loop,
this ensure that the socket doesn't close after sending.
