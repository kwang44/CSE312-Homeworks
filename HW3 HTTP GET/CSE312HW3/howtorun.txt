Some specs of my machine:
Python 3.8.1
Window 10
PyCharm 2019.3.3 x64
Google Chrome

Note, I used pycharm to develope this code
Please clean cookies =)

1.)
To run my program

In the same directory as my tcpserver.py

In a command line, do:
python tcpserver.py
(I'm using python 3.8.1)

In a browser (I used Chrome), go to localhost:8000
Please make sure port 8000 is not taken

The browser should display my blue html website
Hit the "Add a row" and the table should increase in row, that is my javascript at work.

On chrome, right click->inspect->source, there should be 3 files. 1 html, 1 css, and 1 javascript
That should complete objective 1

click on "go to list button:
There should be an image under the list.
This complete my objective 2


For objective 3: go back to localhost:8000
Quickly refresh the page, there should be a new image and the text should change.
(the cookie expire every 10 seconds after cookie is set)
On the page, Inspect->Application->Cookies
If you keep refreshing, the number of visits should increase by 1 each time and dissapear after 10 second of doing nothing.
That is my objective 3

For objective 4: go to localhost:8000/comments
In the url bar, enter these one by one:
localhost:8000/comments?add=First%20Car
localhost:8000/comments?add=Second%20Child
localhost:8000/comments?add=Third%20Phone
localhost:8000/comments?add=Fourth%20Job
localhost:8000/comments?add=Fifth%20Banana
(the %20 represent a space)

The browser should have:
0: First Car

1: Second Child

2: Third Phone

3: Fourth Job

4: Fifth Banana

the number on the left is the index
Now enter: 
localhost:8000/comments?remove=2 
into the url bar
The "2: Third Phone" should be removed

comments?add=string is for adding to comment
comments?remove=string is for removing to comment

refreshing the page send multiple query
This conclude my objective 4



This project have parts from HW1 and HW2, tcp part of the server is the same.
The http is heavyly changed.

For objective 1, I just change the Content-Type to text/html and serve the html code similar to HW2(after reading it from my html files)
This is the same for css and javascript

For objective 2, the Content-Type is changed to image/jpeg and the rest is simliar to objective 1

For objective 3, I added the Set-Cookie in the http response to the home page of localhost:8000
The cookie has key=value of visits=number where number represent the number of visit. The cookie has
max-life of 10 seconds where it reset after 10 seconds.

For objective 4, my code look for /comments in the url path. After it got it, the code look for the '?' character
The code then look for if it remove or add or just serve the response.
