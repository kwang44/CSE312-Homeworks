1. You can use the files in the zip files or https://cse.buffalo.edu/~kwang44/

2. open list.html (I used chrome)
The html page have a list and a button that link to the table

3. click the button to go to table.html
The html page have a table and 2 buttons
The first button go link to list
The second button add a row to the table


I used onclick="window.location.href='example.html'" to link the page to each other in the button.
The "add a row" button called a java script function that would edit the html.
The CSS is exactly what we did in class.
