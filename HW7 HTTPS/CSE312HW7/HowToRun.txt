Some specs of my machine:
Python 3.8.1
Window 10
PyCharm 2019.3.3 x64
Google Chrome

1.)
In my folder, there is cert.pem and private.key
This is my objective 1

2.)
To run my program

In the same directory as my tcpserver.py

In a command line, do:
python tcpserver.py
(I'm using python 3.8.1)

In a browser (I used Chrome), go to https://localhost:8000
Please make sure port 8000 is not taken
the https part is important

if visiting the site for first time on chrome,
it will give you a "Your connection is not private"
along with NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID

This mean https has been implemented but with a bad CA
This is my objective 3

3.)
click Advanced then Proceed to localhost (unsafe)
If you go to sources, there should be 3 files, the html, javascript, and the image.

Bonus: same as hw7 websocket but now uses wss instead of just ws

Project architecture:
Literally 1 line of code has been changed
Basically switching the socket from server to the one provided by the sll library
