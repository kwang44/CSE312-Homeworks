Some specs of my machine:
Python 3.8.1
Window 10
PyCharm 2019.3.3 x64
Google Chrome

301 and 404 from HW2 does not exist

Note, I used pycharm to develope this code
Please clean cookies =)

1.)
To run my program

In the same directory as my tcpserver.py

In a command line, do:
python tcpserver.py
(I'm using python 3.8.1)

In a browser (I used Chrome), go to localhost:8000
Please make sure port 8000 is not taken

Click on "Objective 1: AJAX GET" or go to http://localhost:8000/ajax_get.html if link doesn't work
Go to network section of inspect and refresh the page.
The second block of text is the ajax request
There should be 3 request, the ajax request is the get_time which return date and time of the server.
This conclude objective 1

2.) go back to localhost:8000 and click on "Objective 2 and 3: AJAX POST AND GET"
this should land you on http://localhost:8000/ajax_post_get.html

type any random message in user name and chat and click send. This will trigger a post to server.
Click update message from server, this is the get.

the ajax functions is in ajax_post_get_script.js
The function send and receive JSON

This conclude my objective 2 and 3

3.) open http://localhost:8000/ajax_polling.html in 2 tabs.
Note: I use the same function as previous objectives, so previous message also should be displayed
Send any messages in 1 of them and it should be displayed on the other one.
The javascript polling is to 500ms

I tested the html injection with these I copied from w3schools. They should be displayed as normal text
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>
<button type="button">Click Me!</button>
This conclude my objective 4

My software architecture:
Objective 1 is very similar to hw3 but with added response to the ajax
Objective 2 and 3 was done together, the post and and response are in JSON format
Objective 4 is hooked onto code already in 2 and 3 but with setInterval(recieveMessage, 500); to the javascript
the replace string function is what I used for html injection.
