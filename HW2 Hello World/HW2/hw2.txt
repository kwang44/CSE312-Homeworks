Some specs of my machine:
Python 3.8.1
Window 10
PyCharm 2019.3.3 x64
Google Chrome

Note, I used pycharm to develope this code


1. To run my program

In the same directory as my tcpserver.py

In a command line, do:
python tcpserver.py
(I'm using python 3.8.1)

In a browser (I used Chrome), go to localhost:8000
Please make sure port 8000 is not taken

The browser should display the exact message it send to the server.
I just add the http response header to what the browser get request and send it back.

This is my way of confirming tcp server has worked and showing objective 1 has been completed


2. my "Hello World!"
go to: localhost:8000/hello
There should be a plain text of "Hello World!"
This is my way of doing objective 2

3. for 301 redirect, just go to
localhost:8000/301

it should be redirected to localhost:8000/hello

4. for 401
just do localhost:8000/ followed by random string ex: localhost:8000/sdijsfdij
should get a 404


i used python's socketserver library
The main function basically start the tcp server and then start a infinite loop with the socketserver

The handle function get called everytime the server get an input. The rest is just setting the correct http responses as byte string.
